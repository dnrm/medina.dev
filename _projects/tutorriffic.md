# Tutorriffic

Tutorriffic, where the best tutors meet the best learners. Tutorriffic is a mobile app designed to connect schoolmates into one-to-one tutoring sessions. This app was part of **ROBOHackIT 2022**, a 24 hour hackathon organised by James W. Robinson Secondary School. My team's project won the **Best Use of Google Cloud award**. The app was built using Flutter and Firebase.
