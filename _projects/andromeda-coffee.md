# Andromeda Coffee

---

Welcome to Andromeda Coffee my personal coffee brand. We are a brand that focuses on giving the consumer the best coffee experience they've ever had. I make deliveries in my school campus and provide a wide variety of specialty coffee drinks. Its website was built primarily using React.js and TailwindCSS, although it also uses Strapi as a backend headless CMS hosted in a Heroku Dyno _(Which will have to change since Heroku is removing free plans)_. The site fetches menu items from the CMS and displays them. Then the user selects their order and i receive a message containing the items and order total.

The drinks we provide are:

- Americano
- Espresso
- Cold Brew
- Latte (Optional: caramel or vainilla syrup)
- Pour Over
- Iced Latte

I invite you to check out Andromeda Coffee's website and take a look at the design and functionality of it. [Visit Website](https://andromeda.medina.dev/)
