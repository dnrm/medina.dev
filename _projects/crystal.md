A website built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS

Crystal is a blogging platform I built in mid-2021 to first try out Next.js. As you might already have noticed, I instantly fell in love with the way Next.js made things easier and provided a powerful developer environment ready for any heavy workload or task. You can create posts, view them, change your account settings, and it even has file uploads!
