# VOLTEC Robotics 6647

---

This website was made for the FRC team [VOTLEC Robotics 6647](https://www.instagram.com/voltecrobotics6647/) from PrepaTec Eugenio Garza Lagüera. It consists of a landing page with general information on the team, as well as an administration system where users can upload newspapers which inside the team we call VOLTEC Weekly. This is by far one of my favourite projects I've ever done due to the love I have for the team.
