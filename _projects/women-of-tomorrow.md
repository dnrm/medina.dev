# Women of Tomorrow

---

Women of Tomorrow was an event dedicated to showing middle and high-school girls about their possibilities in the STEAM world organised by FRC team VOLTEC Robotics 6647, which I was a part of. The event was held on November 25th and 26th in PrepaTec Eugenio Garza LagÃ¼era, Monterrey, Mexico. 

The event featured conferences from experienced women in different fields of STEAM, as well as interactive workshops led by both team members and women with experience in STEAM. The conferences touched topics such as women empowerment, finances, and entrepeneurship, while the workshops covered topics such as robotics, programming, and digital design. 

My role in the event was designing the whole branding of the event: banners, staff and participant badges, presentations, logos, social media posts, flyers, invitations, and stickers, as well as all the fonts, colors, layouts, and their meaning behind it. The first step to complete the branding was to lay down what emotions and intentions I wanted the branding to convey. I went for a powerful but yet formal design language that used different shades of purple and pink. Once the design language was complete, I worked alongside my digital design team to put out all the required resources. During the event I also led the media coverage of the event by forming a team of people and successfully setting up the logistics and covering all conferences and workshops.
