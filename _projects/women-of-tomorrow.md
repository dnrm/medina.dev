# Women of Tomorrow

---

I worked on the project "Women of Tomorrow", where I led the design team and created the branding for the event.

Women of Tomorrow was an event dedicated to showing middle and high-school girls about their possibilities in STEAM, organised by FRC team VOLTEC Robotics 6647, of which I am a member. The event was held on November 25th and 26th in PrepaTec Eugenio Garza LagÃ¼era, Monterrey, Mexico.

The event featured conferences from experienced women in different fields of STEAM, as well as interactive workshops led by team members and women with high levels of expertise in STEAM. The conferences explained topics such as women empowerment, finances, and entrepreneurship, while the workshops covered topics such as robotics, programming, and digital design.

My role in the event was conceiving the branding: banners, staff and participant badges, presentations, logos, social media posts, flyers, invitations, and stickers, not to forget the fonts, colours, layouts, and their meaning behind them.

The first step to complete the branding was to lay down what emotions and intentions we wanted the branding to convey. We went for a powerful and formal design language that used distinct shades of purple and pink. Once the design language was complete, my design team and I worked cooperatively to put out all the required resources. During the event, I led the media coverage by forming a group of photographers and videographers that successfully covered all conferences and workshops.

I am thankful for having had the opportunity to participate in this event dedicated to changing the lives of more than a hundred girls in my immediate community.
