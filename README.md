## My personal portfolio
---
This is my personal portfolio. I built it with `Next.js` and `Chakra UI`. It has some paragraphs about me, my skills, certifications, projects i've done, blog posts i've published, my favourite technologies, and as a bonus, my vinyl record collection. The footer also includes a widget that shows what I'm listening to in Spotify in case you're curious.

It also includes a page with all ways of contacting me including my twitter, github, email and much more.

If you would like to suggest an edit or notice an error within the code or with the spelling/grammar feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request.

Check it out [here](https://medina.dev). Thank's for checking it out! <3
