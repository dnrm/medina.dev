## My personal portfolio
---
This is my personal portfolio. It is built with `Next.js` and `Chakra UI`. It has my short bio, my skills, projects i've done, blog posts i've published, and my favourite technologies. It also includes a widget that shows what I'm listening to in Spotify. 

If you would like to suggest an edit or notice an error within the code or with the spelling/grammar feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request.

Check it out [here](https://medina.dev). Thank's for checking it out! <3
