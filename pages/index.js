                    My name is Daniel Medina. I am a high school student at
                    TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey. I started my journey as a web
                    developer in January of 2020. During the COVID-19 pandemic I
                    had a lot of free time therefore I was able to really bump
                    up my skills. I started experimenting with all kinds of
                    technologies and projects. As of August 2021 I have made 4
                    big projects which are listed above. I have also done some
                    small projects which can be found in my Github profile.

                    I spend my free time listening and composing music, taking
                    photos, sailing, and coding. I also love collecting vinyl
                    records. I currently have a small collection of them, but
                    plan to expand it indefinitely. Check out my collection
                    here.
